fieldfunds
==========

Contains public financial info from the Field Museum in a more [usable form](https://raw.github.com/bomeara/fieldfunds/master/FieldMuseum.txt) . I also include sample code to parse the information and do a few plots. Some sample plots (I'm hoping others will do better):

*Percent change in funding:*
[![Percent change in funding](https://github.com/bomeara/fieldfunds/blob/master/PercentSpendingChange.png?raw=true)](#percentchange)



*Effect of investment returns:*
[![Investment returns](https://github.com/bomeara/fieldfunds/blob/master/AssetsVsInvestment.png?raw=true)](#investment)

The Field Museum budget has many costs (education, collections, cost to get donors, etc.) and inputs (grants, sponsorships, admissions, etc.). This plot suggests that much of the growth or decline of net assets is being driven by investment returns.


*Effect of marketing (linear regression)*
[![Marketing impact](https://github.com/bomeara/fieldfunds/blob/master/MarketingImpact.png?raw=true)](#marketing)

This suggests that marketing doesn't pay off well, but note this doesn't control for other factors; maybe more marketing makes the losses less bad in down years, for example.
